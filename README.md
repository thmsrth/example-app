## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

###  `Environment Variables`

In the .env file you can define the environment variables you want to use. Important note you have to add the prefix REACT_APP_ to every environment variable.

Examples:

`REACT_APP_ADMIN_URL=https://admin-develop.test.com`

If you want to obfuscate your variables you can add them to your start or build command:

`REACT_APP_URL=http://test.de npm run start`
